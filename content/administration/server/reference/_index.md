## Components

The server is made up of several components, responsible for specific tasks, necessary for the service to operate:

| Name       | Description                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compiler` | transforms a [pipeline](/docs/tour/) into an executable workload for the [worker](/docs/administration/worker/)     |
| `database` | integrates with a database provider for storing application data at rest                                            |
| `queue`    | integrates with a queue provider for pushing workloads that will be run by a [worker](/docs/administration/worker/) |
| `secret`   | integrates with a secret provider for storing sensitive application data at rest                                    |
| `source`   | integrates with a source control management (SCM) provider for authentication and authorization                     |
