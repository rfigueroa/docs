## Components

The worker is made up of several components, responsible for specific tasks, necessary for the service to operate:

| Name       | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `executor` | coordinates with the runtime to manage workload resources and reports results back to the [server](/docs/administration/server/) |
| `queue`    | integrates with a queue provider for pulling workloads, provided by the [server](/docs/administration/server/), that will be run |
| `runtime`  | integrates with a runtime environment for executing workload resources                                                           |
