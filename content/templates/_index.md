A template is a pipeline with one to many defined steps that can be sourced into another pipeline. Templates can live in any repository in a [source control system](/docs/concepts/infrastructure/server/source/) and are expanded at compile time to create the final executable pipeline.

Templates can take the form of generalized workflows across repositories or complex workflows like matrices in a single build.

The following YAML tags are not valid inside a template pipeline:

* `stages:`
* `templates:`
{{% /alert %}}

## Template Engines

### Format

By default, templates utilize the Go template language unless otherwise specified. You may opt to specify the `format` key to switch the template language to one of the following:

* `format: go`
* `format: golang`
* `format: ""`
* `format: starlark`

### Go Template

[Go Templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) is the default formatter for building out template pipelines. We extend Go's built-in template functions by utilizing the [sprig library](http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/) in the engine to allow for more options on top of the Go template syntax.

Let's take a look at a basic template:

{{% alert color="tip" %}}
For this example we will call it `build.yml` but the YAML does not have a required name.
{{% /alert %}}

```yaml
metadata:
  template: true

steps:
  - name: Test and Build
    commands:
      - go test ./...
      - go build
    image: {{ .image }}
    pull: always
    ruleset:
      event: [ push, pull_request ]
```

The caller of this template could look like:

```yaml
version: "1"
templates:
  - name: go
    source: github.com/octocat/hello-world/.vela/build.yml
    format: go
    type: github

steps:
  - name: sample
    template:
      name: go
      vars:
        image: golang:latest
```

### Starlark

[Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark) is a configuration language that was designed for the [Bazel build system](https://bazel.build/). The language is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) dialect that exists for advanced configuration management that can require complex structures. The language is dynamically typed and allows for all sorts of language-esque primitives to make writing large configuration files more manageable.

It is recommended users read the [Starlark Spec](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark/blob/master/spec.md) to understand the syntax differences between Python and Starlark. Python IDE tools are compatible with Starlark to assist users in writing their `.star` or `.py` template pipelines.

Let's take a look at a basic template:

{{% alert color="tip" %}}
For this example we will call it `build.star` but the file does not have a required name.
{{% /alert %}}

```python
def main(ctx):
  return {
    'version': '1',
    'steps': [
      {
        'name': 'build',
        'image': ctx["vars"]["image"],
        'commands': [
          'go build',
          'go test',
        ]
      },
    ],
}
```

The caller of this template could look like:

```yaml
version: "1"
templates:
  - name: starlark
    source: github.com/octocat/hello-world/.vela/build.star
    format: starlark
    type: github

steps:
  - name: sample
    template:
      name: starlark
      vars:
        image: golang:latest
```
